    <!-----Grid 1: Create a div tag with the class of “gridOne”. 
    Create two paragraph tags that respectively say “Hello World” and “My Fantastic Content”. 
    This grid should have two equally sized columns. 
    Use inline styling to turn the text of the second paragraph tag blue. ------>

    <div class="gridOne">
        <p>Hello World</p>
        <p style="color:blue">My fantastic content</p>
    </div>


<div class="space-maker"><h1></h1></div>

    <!-----Grid 2: Create another div tag in the same HTML file. 
    Make sure that none of the grids are nested inside each other. 
    Give this div the class of “gridTwo”. Create three divs inside of gridTwo, 
    this means that they will be child divs in relation to gridTwo. 
    Assign them each a unique class. Add a paragraph tag to each of the divs with whatever text you would like.
    Each child div should have its own different background color. Try using red, blue, and yellow. 
    This grid should have three columns. The third column should be twice as large as the first two columns. 
    The background colors will help you identify if the sizes created by your grid-template-columns are correct. ------>

    <div class="gridTwo">
        <div class="class1">
            <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Eum, beatae.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class2">
            <p>Architecto nihil assumenda omnis unde officia voluptatum quasi, voluptates iusto?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="class3">
            <p>Corrupti omnis autem quasi, ab necessitatibus deserunt nisi vel eligendi.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

<div class="space-maker"><h1></h1></div>


<!-------- Grid 3: Create another div tag in the same HTML file. Give this div the class of “gridThree”. 
Create two child divs inside of gridThree and give them both a unique class. 
The first child div should contain a paragraph tag and the second should contain an image of your choice. 
This grid should have two rows. The second row should be three times as large as the first. 
Use background colors again to help make the sizes clear. Give gridThree a width of 500 pixels and a height of 300 pixels. 
*Make sure that you give the image a width of 500 pixels and a height of 225 pixels. 
You will also need to make sure that object-fit equals cover so that the image will not be distorted or too large for the row. ------>

<div class="gridThree">
    <div class="class1">
        <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Adipisci, doloribus.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="class2">
        <img src="assets/img/gorilla2.jpeg" alt="some image">
    </div>
